            <h1>Pat's Salmon Cookies</h1>
            Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show
            to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more
            shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one
            of the ones that became nothing.

            Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm
            in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it
            don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it
            over to your dumb ass.
